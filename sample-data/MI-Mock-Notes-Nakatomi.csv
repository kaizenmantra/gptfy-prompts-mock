"NOTE-001","Account Strategy FY2025","ACC-NPB-001","Account","2025-01-01","Sarah Chen","STRATEGIC ACCOUNT PLAN: NPB is our largest banking client in North America. Key growth opportunities: 1) Expand into Investment Banking division (currently using Bloomberg exclusively), 2) Cross-sell ESG analytics as regulatory pressure increases, 3) Displace Moody's in remaining credit analytics workloads. WATCH OUTS: Bloomberg relationship very strong in London, CFO focused on cost reduction for 2025. RELATIONSHIP DYNAMICS: Hans Gruber is our strongest executive champion - use him to influence other divisions. London office operates independently - need local champion there urgently.","FALSE"
"NOTE-002","Competitive Intelligence - Bloomberg","ACC-NPB-001","Account","2024-12-15","Sarah Chen","BLOOMBERG COMPETITIVE SITUATION: Bloomberg has 60% wallet share at NPB, primarily in trading and IB. Their relationship: 20+ years, exec relationships including golf/social with London head of trading. Weaknesses we can exploit: 1) Poor customer service complaints from APAC, 2) Limited private company data, 3) No success-based pricing flexibility, 4) ESG data is weak. They offered 40% discount to block our data feeds deal - NPB used this to negotiate with us but prefers our innovation roadmap.","FALSE"

"NOTE-005","London Office Political Dynamics","OPP-NPB-002","Opportunity","2024-10-30","Sarah Chen","LONDON RESISTANCE ANALYSIS: Head of London trading (James Mitchell) blocking Capital IQ expansion. Issues: 1) Personal relationship with Bloomberg rep (golf buddies, kids in same school), 2) Doesn't want to retrain 50+ traders, 3) Gets personal perks from Bloomberg (box seats at Wimbledon). Strategy to overcome: 1) Bottom-up adoption through junior traders who love our Excel plugin, 2) Get Hans to mandate global standardization, 3) Show productivity gains from APAC that London is missing. Ellis flying to London in February to build internal support.","TRUE"
"NOTE-006","CFO Budget Concerns","ACC-NPB-001","Account","2025-01-10","Michael Harrison","BUDGET INTELLIGENCE: CFO under pressure to cut vendor spend by 15% in 2025. NPB missed Q4 earnings by 8%. Budget freeze possible if Q1 earnings miss. Our contracts represent 0.3% of their IT budget. CFO's main concerns: 1) Too many vendors (they have 47 data vendors), 2) Overlapping capabilities, 3) No clear ROI metrics. Our response: 1) Consolidation story saves them $1.2M, 2) Documented ROI of 3.2x, 3) Success-based pricing shows confidence. Hans can override CFO for strategic initiatives under $5M.","FALSE"
"NOTE-007","Moody's Displacement Strategy","OPP-NPB-004","Opportunity","2024-11-01","Sarah Chen","COMPETITIVE DISPLACEMENT: Moody's has $4.5M annual contract expiring March 2025. Their weaknesses at NPB: 1) Poor customer service (3 account team changes in 2 years), 2) Model accuracy declined (our models 15% better in backtesting), 3) No innovation in 3 years, 4) Integration problems with their new platform. They're desperate - offered 45% discount and threatened to pull other products. Our strategy: 1) Success-based pricing shows confidence, 2) Migration support included, 3) Holly's team prefers our UI, 4) Hans already approved displacement. Legal reviewing termination requirements.","FALSE"
"NOTE-008","ESG Pilot Results","OPP-NPB-003","Opportunity","2025-01-15","Michael Harrison","PILOT UPDATE WEEK 6: Coverage at 94% of portfolio (target was 90%). Found material ESG risks in 3 holdings that were missed by current process - potential $12M exposure avoided. Maria very impressed and socializing results. Challenges: 1) CFO wants to wait for regulatory clarity, 2) Competing priority with blockchain initiative, 3) Data differences with MSCI need explanation. Next steps: 1) Build financial model showing compliance cost avoidance, 2) Get Hans to position as risk mitigation not cost center, 3) Extend pilot 30 days to build more evidence.","FALSE"

"NOTE-010","Relationship Building with Theo","CON-NPB-006","Contact","2024-11-30","Sarah Chen","CONVERTING THE SKEPTIC: Theo initially favored Refinitiv due to existing Microsoft relationship. Conversion points: 1) Our data quality metrics (99.7% vs 97.2% accuracy), 2) Real-time processing capabilities, 3) Lower TCO over 5 years, 4) Innovation roadmap aligned with his 3-year strategy. Now our champion for data feeds deal. Key interests: 1) AI/ML capabilities, 2) Data lineage and governance, 3) API performance.

"NOTE-011","Account Risk Assessment","ACC-NPB-001","Account","2025-01-20","Sarah Chen","ACCOUNT RISKS: 1) HIGH: Budget freeze if Q1 earnings miss (Mitigation: Get contracts signed before Feb 15 earnings), 2) MEDIUM: Bloomberg retaliation could impact other opportunities (Mitigation: Exec relationships and ROI documentation), 3) MEDIUM: London resistance could limit expansion (Mitigation: Local champion development and Hans mandate), 4) LOW: Integration delays affecting user adoption (Mitigation: Dedicated technical resources assigned).
